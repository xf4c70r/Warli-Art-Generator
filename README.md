# Warli Art Generator

Warli painting is tribal art characterized by its unique style and intricate patterns mostly created by the tribal people from the North Sahyadri Range in Maharashtra, India. 

My goal here is to use diffrent image generation techniques like GANs (Generative Adversarial Network) and Diffusion to create new and unique art using shapes and patterns of Warli Design




## Dataset Used:
